    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>COMPUTER AND ITS PARTS</u></b></h1>

  <p>A computer is a programmable device that stores, retrieves, and
     processes data. The term "computer" was originally given to humans 
     (human computers) who performed numerical calculations using
      mechanical calculators, such as the abacus and slide rule. The term 
      was later given to mechanical devices as they began replacing human 
      computers. Today's computers are electronic devices that accept
       data (input), process that data, produce output, and store (storage) 
       the results (IPOS).</p>

</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"  ><u>Computer Overview</u></h2>
<p>Below is a picture of a computer with each of the main 
    components. You can see the desktop computer, flat-panel
     display, speakers, keyboard, and mouse in the picture below. 
     We've also labeled each of the input devices and output devices.</p>

     <h2><u>History of the computer</u></h2>
     <p>The first digital computer and what most people think of as a computer was called the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). It was built during World War II (1943-1946) and was designed to help automate the calculations being done by human computers. By doing these calculations on a computer, they could achieve results much faster and with fewer errors.

The first generation of computers, such as the ENIAC, used vacuum tubes and were often as large as entire rooms. These machines were primarily used by large corporations, universities, or governments. Later, computers began using transistors and smaller and cheaper parts that allowed the ordinary person to own a computer.</p>

<h2><u>How are computers used today?</u></h2>
<p>Today, computers simplify tasks that were once complex and time-consuming. For example, you can write a letter in a word processor, edit it anytime, spell check, print copies, and send it to someone across the world in seconds. All these activities would have taken someone days, if not months, to do before. Also, these examples are a small fraction of what computers can do.</p>
<h2>What components make up a desktop computer?</h2>
<p>Today's desktop computers have some or all the components
         (hardware) and peripherals below. As technology advances, 
         older technologies, such as a floppy disk drive and zip drive
          (shown below), are no longer required or included.</p>

<h2><u>What parts are needed for a computer to work?</u></h2>
<p>A computer doesn't require all the components mentioned above.
     However, a computer cannot function without having at the very
      minimum the parts listed below.</p>
      <ul>
<li>Processor - Component that executes instructions from the software and hardware.</li>
<li>Motherboard (with onboard video) - Component that connects all components.</li>
<li>Storage device (e.g., hard drive) - Slower secondary storage that permanently stores data.</li>

<p>A computer with only these essential parts works but doesn't allow user interaction until at least one input device (e.g., keyboard) is connected. Also, you would need at least one output device (e.g., monitor) for you to see what is happening.</p>
<h2><u>Types of computers</u></h2>
<p>Computers can be classified as one of three types of computers: a general-purpose computer, special-purpose computer, or specialized computer.</p>
<p>A general-purpose computer is what most people think of when thinking about a computer and is what this page covers.</p>
<p>A special-purpose computer is embedded in almost all electronic devices and is the most widely-used computer. This computer is designed for a specific task and is found in ATMs, cars, microwaves, TVs, the VCR (Video Cassette Recorder), and other home electronics. See our special-purpose computer page for further information and examples.</p>
<p>A specialized computer is like a general-purpose computer but is designed only to perform one or a few different tasks. See our specialized computer for further information and examples of these computers.</p>
<p>When discussing a computer or a "PC," you're usually referring to a desktop computer found in a home or office. However, the lines of what makes these computers are blurring. Below are different examples of what's considered a computer today.</p>

      <p>The technology behind the primary generation of 
        computers was a fragile glass device, which was called a vacuum
         tube. These computers were very heavy and really large. These 
         weren't very reliable, and programming on them was a tedious
          task as they used a low-level programming language and had no 
          OS. First-generation computers were used for calculation, 
          storage, and control purposes. They were too bulky and 
          large; they needed a full room and consumed a lot of 
          electricity. Punch cards were used to improve the 
          information for external storage. Magnetic card used.
           Machine and assembly language is developed.</p>

        <ul><li><b><h2>Second Generation Of Computer</h2></b></li></ul>
        Second-generation computers used the technology of transistors rather than bulky vacuum tubes. Another feature was the core storage. A transistor may be a device composed of semiconductor material that amplifies a sign or opens or closes a circuit.
       <center> <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250716124242011410/second_generation_of_computer.webp"></center>
<p>
Transistors were invented in Bell Labs. The use of transistors made it possible to perform powerfully and with due speed. It reduced the dimensions and price and thankfully the warmth too, which was generated by vacuum tubes. Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, programming language, and input, and output units also came into the force within the second generation.

The programming language was shifted from high level to programming language and made programming comparatively a simple task for programmers. Languages used for programming during this era were FORTRAN (1956), ALGOL (1958), and COBOL (1959).

</p>
<ul><li><h2>Third Generation Computers</h2></li></ul>
<p>During the third generation, technology envisaged a shift from huge transistors to integrated circuits, also referred to as ICs. Here, a variety of transistors were placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors. The most important feature of this era’s computers was speed and reliability. IC was made from silicon, also called silicon chips.</p>
<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250716124241812356/third_generation_of_computer.webp"></center>

<p>The computer programs was designed to make the machine work. Operating system was a program designed to handle a machine completely. Because of the operating system machine could execute multiple jobs simultaneously. Integrated circuits were used to replace many transistors used in the second generation.

A single IC has many transistors, registers, and capacitors built on one thin slice of silicon. The value size was reduced, and memory space and dealing efficiency were increased during this generation. Programming was now wiped out Higher level languages like BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). Minicomputers found their shape during this era.

<ul><li><h2>Fourth Generation Computers</h2></li></ul>
<p>In 1971 First microprocessors were used, the large-scale of integration LSI circuits built on one chip called microprocessors. The advantage of this technology is that one microprocessor can contain all the circuits required to perform arithmetic, logic, and control functions on one chip. LSI placed thousands of transistors onto a single chip.</p>
<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250716124242225275/fourth_generation_of_computer.webp"></center>
<p>The computers using microchips were called microcomputers. This generation provided even smaller-sized computers with larger capacities. That's not enough, then Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits replaced LSI circuits. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the pc from the central processing unit and memory to input/ output controls on one chip and allowed the dimensions to reduce drastically. VLSI placed several hundred thousand transistors on a single silicon chip. This silicon chip is known as the microprocessor.

Technologies like multiprocessing, multiprogramming, time-sharing, operating speed, and virtual memory made it a more user-friendly and customary device. The concept of private computers and computer networks came into being within the fourth generation.</p>

<ul><li><h2>Fifth Generation Computers</h2></li></ul>
<p>The technology behind the fifth generation of computers is AI. It allows computers to behave like humans. It is often seen in programs like voice recognition, the area of medicine, and entertainment. Within the field of game playing also it has also shown remarkable performance where computers are capable of beating human competitors.</p>
<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250716124242548683/fifth_generation_of_computer.webp"></center>

<p>
The speed is the highest, the size is the smallest and the area of use has remarkably increased within the fifth generation computers. Though not a hundred per cent AI has been achieved to date, keeping in sight the present developments, it is often said that this dream also will become a reality very soon.

To summarize the features of varied generations of computers, it is often said that a big improvement has been seen so far because of the speed and accuracy of functioning care, but if we mention the dimensions, it's been small over the years. The value is additionally diminishing and reliability is increasing.
